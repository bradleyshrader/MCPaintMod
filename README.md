MCPaintMod
==========

My first mod; adds a plethora of items. Most notably it adds a paint gun, which can color individual sides of most items whatever color you like. Their are 1,677,721,600 possible colors in the RGBA scale, and 360,000,000 in the HSVA scale to choose from. Never again will you have to choose the same color for your kitchen AND living room.
